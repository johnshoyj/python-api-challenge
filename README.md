# python-api-challenge 

In this challenge I worked on two separate analyses. In the first, VacationPy, I created a map the shows a point for every city in a dataframe, and the point size was based on the humidity level in that city. Next I created a filtered dataframe that accounted for my ideal weather condition (between 70 and 75 degrees). Next, I created a new dataframe with a subset of the original variables and I used the Geopapify API to find the first hotel located withn 10,000 meters of my lat and long. The hotel name and humidity level was than added to the hover message in the previously created map.

For the second analysis, WeatherPy, I created plots to show the relationship between the weather variables and latitude. I then separated the plots into the northern hemisphere and southern hemisphere and created a series of plots each that contained a linear regression, the y intercept, and the r value. For each of the regression plots I discussed the regression model as well as any relationships in the data. 

This analysis was completed by me along with resources provided to me through the UMN Data Science Bootcamp.
